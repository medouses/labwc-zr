# labwc-zr

labwc but with a lousy patch to allow defining regions with absolute coordinates. i hope i didn't break too much considering i'm not at all familiar with the codebase and didn't have an ide to use

ideally i should probably just add support for floating point percentages (which would more elegantly achieve the same end of allowing snap layouts with useless gaps), but again this probably isn't gonna see the light of day
